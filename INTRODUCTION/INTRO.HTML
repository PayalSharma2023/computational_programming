        Myself <b>Payal Sharma</b>, embarking on a new chapter of my educational journey at <b>MMDU Mullana</b>. As I step into this academic realm, I bring with me a diverse range of interests and a genuine enthusiasm for learning. I'm a dynamic individual on a quest to carve my unique path through life.<strong>Drawing inspiration from a diverse range of interests and experiences</strong>, I continuously explore the intricate tapestry of my passions.
    </p>
    <p align = "justify">
        <em>My life's canvas is painted with a variety of interests and experiences, each contributing to the vibrant picture of who I am today</em>. From my days as a <b>skipping enthusiast</b> to my forays into the world of <b>art and creativity</b>, my journey has been marked by an unwavering commitment to growth. I've always believed in the <i>power of exploration</i> and thrive on challenges, often <i>stepping out of my comfort zone</i> to <i><small>discover new horizons</small></i>. Embracing change and learning have become cornerstones of my life philosophy.
    </p>
    <p align = "justify">
        While my journey has had its twists and turns, my ultimate goal remains clear: <i>to make a significant impact on the world</i>. I was born in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, and have two siblings—an elder sister and a younger brother. My father served in the Army, and my mother runs her own business. I changed schools three times. From class one to three, I attended <b>KV Jakhoo Hills Shimla</b>. From class four to five, I was in <b>KV 1 Shahjahanpur</b>, during our time in an army area with our father. This period laid the foundation for the following six years of my life in Ambala Cantt.
    </p>
    <p align = "justify">
        I completed my high schooling from <b>KV1 Ambala Cantt</b> with a <b>91.8%</b> score in <b>class 12th</b>, studying subjects like <u>maths, physics, chemistry, English, and computer science</u>. I started jump rope in class 4, entered competitions in class 7, and was selected for nationals with a gold medal in regionals. This pattern continued in class 8th. However, in class 9, I turned the tables around, winning not only a <b>gold medal at nationals</b> but also getting selected for <b>SGFI (School Games Federation of India)</b>, winning <b>two gold medals</b>—one in an individual event and another in a team event. I received a cash prize of rupees 4500 and the title of <b>Best Cadet in NCC</b>. I was also honored as the Best Student of the Year at the Annual Function.
    </p>
    <p align = "justify">
        I attempted to participate in <b>NCSC</b> with an <b>Ayurveda-based project</b> but didn't succeed. So, I tried again in class 10 with a different project, <b>"Vedic Maths Vs Modern Maths</b>," making it to nationals but falling short there. I scored <b>88.7%</b> in the <b>10th board exam</b>. After that, due to <big>COVID</big>, I lost momentum but regained it in class 12th with the support of teachers and the principal. They allowed me to become the <b>School Captain</b>, and I gave my best, wrapping up my school life.
    </p>
    <p align = "justify">
        Despite scoring good in the JEE and taking a year off, I am now poised to succeed in my chosen field. Enrolled in MMDU, I am pursuing a <b>B.Tech in CSE with a specialization in data science</b>. This field of study aligns perfectly with my curiosity and passion for exploration, providing me with the tools to delve into the ever-evolving world of technology. With a focus on maintaining my scholarship, I am committed to attending classes regularly and maintaining a high percentile.

    <p align = "justify">
        <h3><strike>it is not the end.</strike></h3> As I navigate this exciting phase of my journey, I am driven by the belief that embracing challenges and seeking knowledge are the keys to unlocking success. The canvas of my life continues to expand, and <i>I eagerly look forward to contributing meaningfully to the world</i>, showcasing who I am and what I stand for.
